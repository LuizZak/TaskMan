## TaskMan

A simple MacOS task and time keeping manager.

The goal of this project is to provide a useful, intuitive and simple way of keeping track of time performing tasks by means of recording running segment of times performing such tasks.
The application allows saving states in a JSON-encoded file format called `.tman`.

I currently use this to keep track of time performing tasks at my current job.

This may or may not be useful to you, as well.

### Requirements

- Xcode 8.1
- MacOS 10.11 (El Capitan) or higher
- [Cocoapods 1.1.1](http://cocoapods.org/) (for package management; dependencies are already integrated in repository)
