## TaskMan

A simple MacOS task and time keeping manager.

The goal of this project is to provide a useful, intuitive and simple way of keeping track of time performing tasks by means of recording running segment of times performing such tasks.
In the future, I'll add means to save the recorded tasks and their time segments in CoreData/external file format. 

I currently use this to keep track of time performing tasks at my current job.

This may or may not be useful to you, as well.

### Requirements

- Xcode 8.1
- MacOS 10.11 (El Capitan) or higher
- Cocoapods 1.1.1 (for package management; dependencies are already integrated in repository)
